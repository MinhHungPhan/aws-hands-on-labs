## Introduction

This guide covers the basics of AWS Control Tower and provides step-by-step instructions on how to create a Landing Zone for managing multiple AWS accounts with centralized control, security, and compliance.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have the following:

- An AWS account with administrative access.
- Basic familiarity with AWS services like IAM, S3, and Organizations.
- AWS billing set up and validated.

## What is AWS Control Tower?

**AWS Control Tower** is a service that helps you set up and govern a secure, multi-account AWS environment, known as a **Landing Zone**. It automates the creation of AWS Organizations, Organizational Units (OUs), accounts, and guardrails to ensure compliance and governance across your cloud environment.

## Benefits of Using AWS Control Tower

- **Centralized Management:** Simplifies multi-account AWS environments by providing centralized control.
- **Governance:** Built-in guardrails enforce compliance with AWS best practices.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale your environment as your organization grows.
- **Automation:** Automates many manual tasks, reducing human error and saving time.

## What is Landing Zone?

A **Landing Zone** is a well-architected, multi-account AWS environment that is set up using AWS Control Tower. It provides a secure and scalable foundation for your AWS workloads, ensuring that your accounts are organized, compliant, and governed according to best practices. 
The Landing Zone includes:

- **AWS Organizations**: A central management service that helps you consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage.
- **Organizational Units (OUs)**: Logical groupings of accounts within your organization, allowing you to apply policies and manage permissions at a granular level.
- **Guardrails**: Pre-configured governance rules that help enforce compliance and security policies across your AWS environment.
- **Account Factory**: Automated account creation and configuration, ensuring that new accounts adhere to your organization's policies and standards.

By using a Landing Zone, you can quickly set up a secure, multi-account environment that is ready to support your workloads and applications, while maintaining centralized control and governance.

## AWS Organizations vs AWS Control Tower

### AWS Organizations

**AWS Organizations** is a service that allows you to centrally manage and govern multiple AWS accounts. It provides a way to consolidate billing, apply policies, and automate account creation.

#### When to Use AWS Organizations

- **Centralized Management**: When you need to manage multiple AWS accounts from a single point.
- **Policy Enforcement**: When you need to apply Service Control Policies (SCPs) to enforce governance.
- **Consolidated Billing**: When you want to consolidate billing across multiple accounts.

#### Pros

- **Granular Control**: Fine-grained control over accounts and resources.
- **Cost Management**: Consolidated billing helps in managing costs effectively.
- **Security**: Apply SCPs to enforce security policies across accounts.

#### Cons

- **Complexity**: Requires manual setup and configuration.
- **Limited Automation**: Less automation compared to AWS Control Tower.
- **No Pre-configured Guardrails**: Requires manual setup of governance policies.

### AWS Control Tower

**AWS Control Tower** is a service that automates the setup of a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices. It uses AWS Organizations under the hood but adds automation and pre-configured governance.

#### When to Use AWS Control Tower

- **Automated Setup**: When you want to quickly set up a multi-account environment with best practices.
- **Governance**: When you need pre-configured guardrails for compliance and security.
- **Scalability**: When you need to scale your AWS environment easily.

#### Pros

- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies the setup and management of multi-account environments.
- **Automation**: Automates many tasks, reducing manual effort.
- **Pre-configured Guardrails**: Comes with built-in governance policies.

#### Cons

- **Less Granular Control**: Less fine-grained control compared to AWS Organizations.
- **Cost**: May incur additional costs for the automation and governance features.
- **Limited Customization**: Pre-configured settings may not fit all use cases.

### Summary

- **Use AWS Organizations** if you need granular control over multiple accounts, want to manage costs with consolidated billing, and are comfortable with manual setup and configuration.
- **Use AWS Control Tower** if you want an automated, easy-to-use solution for setting up a secure, multi-account environment with built-in governance and best practices.

Both services can be used together, with AWS Control Tower leveraging AWS Organizations for account management and governance.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console

- Log in to your AWS account with administrative privileges.

- Navigate to the AWS Control Tower service by searching for "Control Tower" in the AWS Management Console.

### Step 2: Enroll AWS Control Tower

Once in the Control Tower dashboard, click **Set up Landing Zone**. AWS Control Tower will guide you through the following steps:

- **Create AWS Organizations**: This groups your accounts into a single organization.
- **Define Organizational Units (OUs)**: These are logical groupings of accounts, such as 'Sandbox' or 'Production'.
- **Configure AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)**: SSO enables secure access management across accounts.
- **Set up Baseline Guardrails**: AWS provides guardrails that help you govern accounts according to best practices.

### Step 3: Create an Organizational Unit (OU)

After the initial setup, you can start defining **Organizational Units (OUs)**, which group accounts based on environment types (e.g., development, production). OUs allow you to apply guardrails and policies to specific groups of accounts.

1. Go to **AWS Organizations**.
2. Select **Create OU**.
3. Name your OU (e.g., `Development` or `Production`).

### Step 4: Set Up Guardrails

Guardrails are governance rules that enforce policies across accounts in your organization. They come in two forms:

- **Preventive Guardrails**: These restrict certain actions or resources.
- **Detective Guardrails**: These monitor your environment and report non-compliance.

Examples:
- **Preventive**: Disallow public read access to S3 buckets.
- **Detective**: Monitor root account activity in AWS accounts.

To set up guardrails:
1. Select your OU from the **AWS Control Tower** dashboard.
2. Navigate to the **Guardrails** section.
3. Choose from a list of pre-configured guardrails and apply them to your OUs.

### Step 5: Manage Accounts

Control Tower allows you to easily create and manage AWS accounts within your organizational units.

1. From the **Control Tower dashboard**, select **Accounts**.
2. Click **Create Account**.
3. Assign the new account to an OU, and configure permissions accordingly.

You can use predefined account types such as `Sandbox`, `Production`, and `Shared Services`.

## Best Practices

1. **Define a clear OU structure:** Organize your accounts logically based on their role (e.g., Dev, Test, Prod).
2. **Start with baseline guardrails:** Use AWS' pre-configured guardrails to ensure compliance without adding too much complexity.
3. **Leverage AWS SSO:** Simplify user access management by integrating AWS Single Sign-On for centralized access.
4. **Monitor regularly:** Use detective guardrails and CloudWatch to keep track of your AWS environment and ensure compliance with policies.
5. **Use AWS Control Tower for scaling:** As your organization grows, take advantage of the automation capabilities of Control Tower to scale securely.

## Key Takeaways

- AWS Control Tower is a powerful tool for setting up and governing a multi-account environment.
- It simplifies the creation of accounts, OUs, and guardrails for a well-governed infrastructure.
- The service promotes secure and compliant practices with minimal manual intervention.

## Conclusion

Setting up a **Landing Zone** using **AWS Control Tower** is a crucial step for organizations managing multiple AWS accounts. It provides a robust framework for security, compliance, and governance, making it easier to scale and manage cloud environments efficiently.

By following this guide, you've set up a secure and compliant AWS environment using AWS Control Tower, ready to accommodate growth and change within your organization.
