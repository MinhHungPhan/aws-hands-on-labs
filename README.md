# AWS Hands-On Labs

This repository provides hands-on lab exercises for Amazon Web Services (AWS) designed to align with AWS Certification levels: 

- Foundational
- Associate
- Professional
- Specialty

Each lab is designed to provide practical experience and knowledge on using different AWS services as per the related certification level. 

## Structure of the repository

This repository is organized into directories, each named after an AWS service, for example `AmazonEC2/`, `AmazonS3/`, etc. Each AWS service directory is then divided into four subdirectories based on certification level:

- `01-foundational/` - These labs focus on the foundational understanding and usage of the service, tailored to the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam.
- `02-associate/` - These labs align with the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate, AWS Certified Developer Associate, and AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate exams.
- `03-professional/` - These labs deal with advanced use-cases as per AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional and AWS Certified DevOps Engineer Professional exams.
- `04-specialty/` - These labs cater to specialized technical roles with AWS services, matching with AWS Certified Advanced Networking, AWS Certified Security, AWS Certified Machine Learning, and other specialty exams.

Each level directory contains multiple labs, each with its own dedicated directory containing all the necessary scripts, templates and a `README.md` file explaining the objective of the lab, instructions, and additional notes if any.
