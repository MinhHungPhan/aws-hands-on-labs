## Introduction

AWS Route 53 Resolver is a DNS resolver service that enables flexible DNS routing within and across AWS accounts. When working with private hosted zones, Route 53 Resolver allows secure DNS resolution for private domain names across multiple AWS accounts, making it essential for large-scale and multi-account AWS setups.

## Components of Route 53 Resolver

### Inbound and Outbound Endpoints

- **Inbound Endpoint**: Receives DNS queries from external sources (such as other AWS accounts) and resolves them within AWS.
- **Outbound Endpoint**: Forwards DNS queries from AWS to external DNS servers.

### Resolver Rules

Resolver rules specify how Route 53 Resolver handles queries:
- **Forward Rules**: Forward DNS queries for specific domains to designated endpoints.
- **System Rules**: Automatically route queries within AWS (e.g., for AWS services).
