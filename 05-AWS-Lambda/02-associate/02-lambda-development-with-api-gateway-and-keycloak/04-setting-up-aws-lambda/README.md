## Introduction

In today's cloud-centric environment, the security of serverless functions forms a foundational pillar for application infrastructure. AWS Lambda, renowned for its serverless compute capabilities, empowers developers to execute code across diverse applications or backend services effortlessly, without the need for server management. Transitioning to authentication and authorization, Keycloak emerges as a formidable choice, delivering comprehensive solutions for user authentication, sign-up, and access management across web and mobile platforms. The synergy between AWS Lambda and Keycloak crafts a fortified architecture, ensuring serverless functions are securely shielded against unauthorized access.

## Understanding AWS Lambda and Keycloak

Before diving into the technical setup, it's important to understand the roles AWS Lambda and Keycloak play in securing serverless applications.

- **AWS Lambda** is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second.

- **Keycloak** is an open-source Identity and Access Management solution aimed at modern applications and services. It offers features such as user federation, identity brokering, and social login. Keycloak makes it easy to secure your applications by providing a comprehensive set of authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Setting Up Your Lambda Function

To get started with AWS Lambda, which will act as the backend for your application, follow the comprehensive steps outlined below:

1. **Navigate to the AWS Management Console** and open the AWS Lambda service.
2. **Create Your Function**: Click on "Create function" and choose "Author from scratch."
3. **Function Details**: Assign a name to your function and select the runtime environment. For our purposes, we will use `Python 3.11`.
4. **Execution Role and Permissions**: Define the necessary execution role and permissions for your Lambda function. This role should have policies that allow it to execute Lambda functions and access any other AWS services your function might need.
5. **Function Code**: Replace the existing code with the Fibonacci sequence code. Here, we provide an example that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number. The number is extracted from the `event` object passed to your Lambda handler.

```python
import json

def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    sequence = []
    for _ in range(n):
        sequence.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return sequence

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Extract the 'n' value from the event object; default is 10 if not provided
    n = event.get('n', 10)
    
    # Calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to n
    fib_sequence = fibonacci(n)
    
    # Return the result
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps({'fibonacci_sequence': fib_sequence})
    }
```

6. **Deploy Your Function**: After entering your function code, proceed to deploy it. This makes your changes active and allows your Lambda function to be invoked with the specified parameters.

## Testing Your Lambda Function

To ensure your Lambda function operates as expected, you can execute a test within the AWS Lambda console:

1. **Configure a Test Event**: In the AWS Lambda console, locate the "Test" button near the top of the page. Click it to configure a test event. Create a new test event with the following JSON to simulate input for your function:

```json
{
    "n": 10
}
```

2. **Execute the Test**: With your test event configured, execute the test by clicking the "Test" button. AWS Lambda will run your function using the test event data.

3. **Review Results**: After the test execution, AWS Lambda displays the results, including the returned output and log output. Ensure the output matches your expectations.

Expected output:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": "{\"fibonacci_sequence\": [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]}"
}
```

## Conclusion

Great work on setting up your AWS Lambda function! You've taken a vital step in learning to deploy scalable, serverless applications. This tutorial laid the groundwork for future lessons, including securing your functions with AWS Cognito. Keep experimenting with Lambda, and look forward to expanding your cloud computing skills in our next guide.
