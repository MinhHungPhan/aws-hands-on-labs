## Introduction

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. Keycloak uses JWTs to allow access to your APIs securely. This guide will walk you through obtaining these tokens using Postman, a popular API client that simplifies the process of making HTTP requests and testing APIs without writing code.

## Setting Up Postman

First, ensure you have Postman installed and set up on your computer. Create a new collection in Postman for organizing your requests related to Keycloak. A collection in Postman is a grouping of individual requests that you can execute separately or as part of a series of requests.

Here's a step-by-step guide to create a new collection named "Fibonacci Calculation API (Keycloak)":

1. **Open Postman:** Launch the Postman application on your computer.

2. **Create New Collection:**
  - In the sidebar on the left, you will see the "Collections" tab. Hover over it, and you'll notice a "New Collection" button (usually represented by a `+` icon or simply says "New"). Click on it.
  - Alternatively, you can click on the "New" button (a `+` icon) in the top left corner, then select "Collection" from the dropdown menu that appears.

3. **Configure Collection:**
  - A dialog box will appear for creating a new collection.
  - **Name:** Enter the name of your collection as "Fibonacci Calculation API (Keycloak)".

## Creating a Post Request for JWT

To get a JWT token from Keycloak, you'll need to create a POST request. This request will be sent to the Keycloak token endpoint configured for your application.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Method: POST
URL: http://<your-keycloak-domain>/auth/realms/<your-realm>/protocol/openid-connect/token
Headers: Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Body:
    - grant_type: password (or client_credentials)
    - client_id: <your-client-id>
    - client_secret: <your-client-secret> (if client_credentials)
    - username: <your-username> (if password grant type)
    - password: <your-password> (if password grant type)
```

Ensure you replace `<your-keycloak-domain>`, `<your-realm>`, `<your-client-id>`, and other placeholders with your specific values.

### Step 1: Creating the "Get JWT" POST Request in Postman

1. **Open Postman:** Start by launching Postman on your computer.

2. **Select Your Collection:** Navigate to the collection you created earlier, such as "Fibonacci Calculation API (Keycloak)". Click on it to open.

3. **Add a New Request:**

- Inside the collection, click on the `...` button next to the collection name or the "Add Request" button within the collection tab.
- A dialog box will appear. Here, enter the name of your request as "Get JWT".
- Optionally, you can add a description to detail the purpose of this request, such as "This request retrieves a JWT token from Keycloak for authorization purposes."
- Click "Save to Fibonacci Calculation API (Keycloak)" or the equivalent button to save your request to your chosen collection.

4. **Select the POST Request:**

- With the "Get JWT" request selected, change the HTTP method to POST by clicking the dropdown next to the URL field and selecting "POST".

## Configuring the Request URL

The request URL is composed of your Keycloak domain followed by the token endpoint path. For a standard Keycloak setup, this might look like `http://<your-keycloak-domain>/auth/realms/<your-realm>/protocol/openid-connect/token`.

### Step 1: Building the URL for the POST Request

1. **Configure the Request Method and URL:**

- Ensure you've selected "POST" as the method.
- Set the URL to your Keycloak's token endpoint, replacing placeholders with your specific values.

2. **Setting Up the Request Body:**

- Select the "Body" tab below the URL field.
- Choose "x-www-form-urlencoded".
- Enter the key-value pairs as mentioned in the example, depending on your grant type.

## Setting Up Authorization

If using the `client_credentials` grant type, include the `client_id` and `client_secret` in the body. For the `password` grant type, the `username` and `password` are also included in the body.

## Sending the Request and Receiving the JWT

- After setting up the URL, body, headers, and potentially authorization, click the "Send" button.
- You should receive a JWT token in the response, which can be used for authorized access to your services.

## Decoding and Understanding the JWT

Decoding and understanding a JSON Web Token (JWT) is essential for verifying the integrity of the token, understanding its payload, and ensuring it has been issued by a trusted issuer. JWTs are compact, URL-safe tokens that represent claims between two parties. They are composed of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature, each base64-url encoded and separated by dots (`.`). Here's a detailed look into decoding and understanding a JWT:

### Decoding the JWT

To decode a JWT, you don't need special tools to simply split the token and decode its Base64Url encoded parts. However, to fully understand and validate it, you might use libraries or online tools like [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/), which not only decode but also help you validate the token's signature and parse the payload.

**Example JWT:**

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvZSBEb2UiLCJpYXQiOjE1MTYyMzkwMjJ9.abc123abc123abc123abc123
```

This JWT is split into three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature.

#### Header

The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token (`typ`), which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used (`alg`), such as HS256 (HMAC with SHA-256) or RS256 (RSA Signature with SHA-256).

**Example Header:**

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

#### Payload

The payload contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.

- **Registered claims:** These are a set of predefined claims which are not mandatory but recommended, to provide a set of useful, interoperable claims. Some of them are: `iss` (issuer), `exp` (expiration time), `sub` (subject), `aud` (audience), etc.
  
- **Public claims:** These can be defined at will by those using JWTs. But to avoid collisions they should be defined in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry or be defined as a URI that contains a collision-resistant namespace.
  
- **Private claims:** These are the custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on using them and are neither registered or public claims.

**Example Payload:**

```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true,
  "iat": 1516239022
}
```

#### Signature

The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way. To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

### Understanding the JWT

- **Integrity and Authentication:** The signature ensures that the JWT hasnâ€™t been altered. Verifying the signature with the public key confirms its authenticity.
- **Expiration (`exp`):** It's essential to check the `exp` claim to ensure the token hasn't expired.
- **Issuer (`iss`):** This claim indicates who issued the token. Verifying the issuer is crucial for trusting the claims within.
- **Subject (`sub`):** Identifies the principal subject of the JWT, often a user ID or identifier specific to the authentication system.
- **Audience (`aud`):** This claim identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. It ensures that the token is sent to the correct party.
- **Issued At (`iat`):** The time the token was issued. It can be used to determine the age of the token.

## Example

Below is an example of a decoded token on jwt.io, related to the project we've been discussing in this tutorial.

## Best Practices

- **Secure Your Secrets:** Never hardcode your client_id and client_secret in your applications. Use environment variables or secrets management services to store them securely.
- **Validate Token:** Always validate the JWT token on your server-side to ensure it's not expired and is signed by a trusted issuer.
- **Scope Management:** Define scopes precisely to limit access to specific resources based on the token.

## Key Takeaways

- Postman can facilitate testing Keycloak's JWT functionality without the need for coding.
- Setting up the request in Postman involves configuring the URL, setting correct headers, and depending on the grant type, setting up the request body with appropriate parameters.
- Understanding JWT structure and validation is crucial for implementing secure authentication and authorization.
- JWT tokens can be decoded to reveal important information about the token's permissions and lifespan.

## Conclusion

This guide has walked you through the process of obtaining JWT tokens from Keycloak using Postman. These tokens enable the secure authorization of users to access your applications and services, reinforcing the importance of secure authentication mechanisms in modern application development.
