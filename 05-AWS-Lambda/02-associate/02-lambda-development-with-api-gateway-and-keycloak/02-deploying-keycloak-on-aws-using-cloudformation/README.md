## Introduction

Keycloak is a powerful, open-source Identity and Access Management solution aimed at modern applications and services. It makes it easy to secure your applications without having to deal with the complexity of implementing security features from scratch. Deploying Keycloak on AWS enhances its capabilities, providing scalability, reliability, and flexibility, essential for handling enterprise-level user authentication and authorization requirements.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with this guide, ensure you have the following:
- An AWS account.
- Basic understanding of AWS CloudFormation, ECS, and VPC.
- The Keycloak CloudFormation template file.

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### Specifying the Template

1. Log in to the **AWS CloudFormation console**.
2. In the left navigation pane, select **Stacks**.
3. Click **Create stacks** and select **With new resources (standard)**.
4. In the **Step 1 Specify template** section, perform the following actions:

- For **Prepare template**, select **Template is ready**.
- For **Template source**, select **Upload a template file**.
- Click **Choose file**, and navigate to your Keycloak CloudFormation template file, for example, `keycloak-aurora-serverless-from-new-vpc.template`.
- Click **Next**.

### Stack Details

Provide the following details:

- **Stack Name**: Assign a unique name, such as `KeycloakOnAWS`.
- **CertificateArn**: Input the ARN of your ACM certificate. This is essential for HTTPS.
- **Hostname**: Specify the domain name for your Keycloak server, such as `keycloak.yourdomain.com`.
- Configure **TaskCPU**, **TaskMemory**, **MinContainers**, **MaxContainers**, **AutoScalingTargetCpuUtilization**, and **JavaOpts** according to your requirements.
- After entering all details, select **Next**.

### Configure Stack Options

Optionally, you can add tags and other configurations in this section. After adjusting as needed, proceed by clicking **Next**.

### Review and Create Stack

Review all the information you've provided. Ensure everything is correct and according to your deployment requirements. Acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources by ticking the acknowledgment box. Finally, click **Create stack** to begin the deployment.

## Best Practices

- **Security**: Ensure your Keycloak deployment follows AWS security best practices, especially regarding network accessibility and data encryption.
- **Scalability**: Leverage AWS's scalability options, like Auto Scaling, to handle load variations efficiently.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Implement regular backups for your Keycloak deployment to ensure you can recover from any unexpected data loss.

## Key Takeaways

- Deploying Keycloak on AWS using CloudFormation simplifies the management of infrastructure and resources.
- Following a structured process ensures a secure, scalable, and efficient deployment.
- Leverage AWS features like Auto Scaling and ACM for an optimized Keycloak setup.

## Conclusion

Deploying Keycloak on AWS using CloudFormation allows for a streamlined setup process, making it easier to manage and scale your identity management solution. This guide aims to provide a clear pathway for setting up Keycloak, emphasizing best practices and key takeaways to ensure a successful deployment. We encourage you to engage further with AWS documentation and Keycloak's community for more insights and advanced configurations.
